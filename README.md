## gans_deep_learning_A

The provided code is an implementation of a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) using PyTorch. GANs are a type of generative model where two neural networks, a generator, and a discriminator, compete against each other to generate realistic data samples. Here's a summary of the code:

Importing Libraries: The necessary libraries for the GAN implementation are imported, including PyTorch, DataLoader, neural network modules, and visualization libraries.

Defining the show Function: This function is used to visualize the generated data samples in a grid format.

Setting Parameters and Hyperparameters: Various hyperparameters such as the number of epochs, learning rate, noise dimension, batch size, and device (GPU or CPU) are defined.

Loading the MNIST Dataset: The code loads the MNIST dataset, which contains images of handwritten digits, and prepares it for training using DataLoader.

Defining the Generator: The generator is defined using a sequence of fully connected layers with batch normalization and LeakyReLU activation functions. The generator takes random noise as input and tries to generate realistic images.

Defining the Discriminator: The discriminator is defined using a sequence of fully connected layers with ReLU activation functions. The discriminator's task is to distinguish between real images from the dataset and fake images generated by the generator.

Initializing the Generator and Discriminator: Instances of the generator and discriminator models are created, and their corresponding optimizers are defined using the Adam optimizer.

Calculating Loss for Generator and Discriminator: Functions are defined to calculate the loss for the generator and discriminator during training.

Training the GAN: The GAN is trained using a loop over the specified number of epochs. In each epoch, the discriminator is trained to distinguish real images from fake ones, and then the generator is trained to generate better fake images that can deceive the discriminator. The losses for both the generator and discriminator are calculated and optimized.

Visualization and Statistics: After a certain number of steps (defined by info_epoch), the GAN's progress is visualized by displaying the generated images and the real images side by side. The generator and discriminator losses are also printed for monitoring.
